HARK! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
And Phoebus 'gins arise, GIT_1
His steeds to water at those springs GIT_1
And Phoebus 'gins arise, GIT_2
His steeds to water at those springs GIT_2
On chaliced flowers that lies;
And winking Mary-buds begin
To ope their golden eyes:
With everything that pretty bin,
My lady sweet, arise!
Arise, arise!
Arise
