Upon her head a platted hive of straw, GIT_1
Which fortified her visage from the sun, GIT_1
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
The carcass of beauty spent and done:
Time had not scythed all that youth begun, GIT_1
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage, GIT_1
Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.

Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
Which on it had conceited characters,
Laundering the silken figures in the brine
